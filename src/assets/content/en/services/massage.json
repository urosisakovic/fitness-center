    "name": "Massage",
    "desc": "Massage is the manipulation of the body's soft tissues. Massage techniques are commonly applied with hands, fingers, elbows, knees, forearms, feet, or a device. The purpose of massage is generally for the treatment of body stress or pain. A person who was professionally trained to give massages was traditionally known as a masseur (male) or a masseuse (female), but those titles are outmoded[citation needed], and carry some negative connotations. To get a massage which perfectly suits your body, check out our 'Book' Menu for additional information. "
