    "desc": "Classical Pilates follows the original system Joseph Pilates created in the 1920s and incorporates both mat and apparatus work. 'Classical varies from other forms of Pilates, because it means that I teach in a traditional order, which includes transitions between exercises,' Pabon says. That makes this type of Pilates good for practitioners who thrive on structure and predictability in their workouts.",
